### Hi there 👋

- 🔭 I’m currently working on [Memphis](https://github.com/JonesBeach/memphis), a Python interpreter written in Rust.
- 👨‍🎓 I love helping others understand how programming languages work under the hood at [From Scratch Code](https://fromscratchcode.com/). Reach out for Rust or Python tutoring, and let’s work together to build your skills!
- 🌐 I have one course (so far!) about building an Axum-inspired [from scratch HTTP Server in Rust](https://fromscratchcode.com/courses/). You can view the final module which is public as [Cairo](https://github.com/JonesBeach/cairo).
- ✍️ I write about my experience with adult-diagnosed autism at [From Scratch dot org](https://fromscratchdotorg.substack.com/). Sometimes there are jokes, gags, or bits, but rarely bytes. Stay here for the bytes.
- 💻 I build in Neovim, Wezterm, tmux, and bash with Starship. Check out my [etc repo](https://github.com/JonesBeach/etc).
