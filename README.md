### Hello and Welcome!

- 👨‍🎓 **Mentoring**: I run [**From Scratch Code**](https://fromscratchcode.com/), where I help developers deepen their expertise in Rust and Python. My aim is to foster your creativity and confidence in a supportive and sometimes silly environment.
- 📬 **Free Email Course**: Want a software career that actually feels *meaningful*? I wrote a 5-day email course on honing your craft, aligning your work with your values, and building for yourself. Or just not hating your job! [**Get it here**](https://fromscratchcode.com/courses/meaningful-career/).
- 🦉 **Current Project**: I'm building [**Memphis**](https://github.com/JonesBeach/memphis), a Python interpreter written in Rust. It can run some code but probably not your code (*yet*).
- ✍️ **Writing**: I share essays on neurodivergence and self-employment at [**From Scratch Press**](https://fromscratchpress.com/).
- 💻 **Tooling**: I use **Neovim**, **WezTerm**, **tmux**, and **bash** spiced up with **Starship**. Explore my [etc repo](https://github.com/JonesBeach/etc) for configs.
