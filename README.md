### Hi there 👋

- 👨‍🎓 **Mentoring**: I run [**From Scratch Code**](https://fromscratchcode.com/), where I help developers deepen their expertise in Rust and Python. My aim is to foster your creativity and confidence in a supportive and sometimes silly environment.
- 🦉 **Current Project**: I'm building [**Memphis**](https://github.com/JonesBeach/memphis), a Python interpreter written in Rust. It can run some code but probably not your code (yet).
- ✍️ **Writing**: I share essays about my journey with late-diagnosed autism and self-employment at [**From Scratch dot org**](https://fromscratchdotorg.substack.com/). I try to blend introspection with frequent gags or bits, but rarely bytes. (Stay here for the bytes!)
- 💻 **Tooling**: I use **Neovim**, **WezTerm**, **tmux**, and **bash** spiced up with **Starship**. Explore my [etc repo](https://github.com/JonesBeach/etc) for configs.
