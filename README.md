### Hi there 👋

- 🔭 I’m currently working on [memphis](https://github.com/JonesBeach/memphis), a Python interpreter written in Rust.
- 💻 I build in Neovim, Wezterm, tmux, and bash with Starship. [etc repo](https://github.com/JonesBeach/etc)
- 👨‍🎓 I offer tutoring in Rust, Python, computer architecture, and software engineering in general. Please reach out [on Discord](https://discord.com/invite/W3AEHyEh4G) if you are interested.
- ✍️ I publish my thoughts and experiences with adult-diagnosed autism [on Substack](https://substack.com/@jonesbeach). Sometimes there are jokes, gags, or bits, but rarely bytes. Stay here for the bytes.
