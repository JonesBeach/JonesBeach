### Hi there 👋

- 👨‍🎓 I love helping others understand how programming languages work under the hood at [From Scratch Code](https://fromscratchcode.com/). Reach out for Rust or Python mentorship, and let’s work together to build your skills in a fun and supportive environment!
  - Some of my technical achievements and jokes make it on [the blog](https://blog.fromscratchcode.com/).
- 🔭 I’m currently working on [Memphis](https://github.com/JonesBeach/memphis), a Python interpreter written in Rust. It can run some code but probably not your code.
- 🌐 I have a course about building an Axum-inspired [HTTP Server in Rust](https://fromscratchcode.com/courses/).
  - You can view [the finished product](https://github.com/JonesBeach/cairo).
- ✍️ I write about my experience with adult-diagnosed autism at [From Scratch dot org](https://fromscratchdotorg.substack.com/). Sometimes there are jokes, gags, or bits, but rarely bytes. Stay here for the bytes.
- 💻 I build in Neovim, Wezterm, tmux, and bash with Starship. Check out my [etc repo](https://github.com/JonesBeach/etc).
