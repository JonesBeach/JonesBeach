### Hi there 👋

- 👨‍🎓 **Mentoring**: I love mentoring experienced developers at [**From Scratch Code**](https://fromscratchcode.com/), focusing on intermediate-to-advanced Rust and Python. Together, we build robust libraries, systems, and real-world tools in a supportive and sometimes silly environment! Check out [my blog](https://blog.fromscratchcode.com/) for technical strivings and frequent jokes.
- 🦉 **Current Project**: I'm building [**Memphis**](https://github.com/JonesBeach/memphis), a Python interpreter written in Rust. It can run some code but probably not your code (yet).
- 🌐 **Rust Course**: Learn to build an Axum-inspired **HTTP server from scratch** in Rust with my course. Check out [the course](https://fromscratchcode.com/courses/) or [the end result](https://github.com/JonesBeach/cairo).
- ✍️ **Writing**: I share my journey as an adult-diagnosed autistic person at [**From Scratch dot org**](https://fromscratchdotorg.substack.com/), blending humor, introspection, and the occasional gag or bit, rarely bytes. Stay here for the bytes.
- 💻 **Tooling**: My setup includes **Neovim**, **WezTerm**, **tmux**, and **bash** with **Starship**. Explore my [etc repo](https://github.com/JonesBeach/etc) for configs.
